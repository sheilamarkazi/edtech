									<h1>Task</h1>
									<p>Your task today is to decide your opinion on which pathway(s) might be good options for you, and which pathways you do not want to take.</p>
									<p>How do you decide if a pathway is a good fit for you? You can decide based on factors such as:
										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>Which jobs are the most interesting to you?</strong> You might find certain healthcare career pathways might be more fun or interesting than others. 
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Which jobs makes enough money for the lifestyle you want to live?</strong> Different degrees/certificates lead to earning different salaries. 
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>How long does it take to complete the necessary degree or certificate?</strong>
													You can meet the qualifications for some jobs by just completing a certificate! Some jobs require a two-year degree that you can earn at WCC. 
													There are other jobs that you can start preparing for at WCC, and then you can finish your degree at a four-year college or university. 
											</li>
										</ul>

								<h1>Lesson Plan</h1>
								<br>
								<h2>Purpose</h2>
								<br>
								<p>
									Most students are familiar with the idea of being a nurse or a doctor when they grow up. 
									They are less familiar with the numerous other career options that exist in healthcare. 
									Our local community college offers 15 affordable healthcare certificates and degrees. 
									This educational material and lesson plan was designed to encourage students to explore their options.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h2>Rationale</h2>
								<br>
								<p>
									There are many job opportunities for those interested in working in healthcare. 
									Students may become interested in those jobs once they learn what they are, 
									their expected salaries, and how much additional schooling they require.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h2>Learner Description</h2>
								<br>
								<p>This educational material and lesson plan was designed for 8th grade students in the Career Investigations course at Grayson County Career and Technical Education Center.</p>
								<br>
								<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
								<br>
								<p>This lesson requires that students be familiar with web browsers and navigating on the internet. 
									In order to organize their information using the provided <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FIoR967tm4RHvXIlvA2mVJx7-lYuiaEV3VgiiCnmVm4/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a>, then students will require 
									familiarity with Google Sheets or another similar spreadsheet programs.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h2>Instructional Objectives</h2>
								<br>
								<p>The learner will compare and contrast 15 healthcare career pathways. Using this information, the learner will decide which pathway is best for themselves.</p>
								<br><p>For each career path, the learner will:
									<br><br>
									<ul>
										<li>Write down job descriptions for the 15 career pathways available at Wytheville Community College (WCC). 
											If adequate descriptions are not available on the WCC websites, students will use Google to discover answers.
										</li>
										<li>Rate, on a scale of one through five, how interesting a career pathway is to them</li>
										<li>Identify whether WCC offers a degree or certificate for each pathway</li>
										<li>Identify the length of time needed to complete the coursework for each career path at WCC</li>
										<li>Identify the median salary in our area</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<br>
								<h2>Standards Addressed</h2>

									<a target="_blank" href="http://cteresource.org/curriculum/career-connections/Career%20Investigations%209070-9069-9068.pdf">9068/9069/9070 Career Investigations</a>.

								</p>
								<p>It contains the following sections for learners:
									<ul>
										<li>Introduction: This section introduces the learner to the objective of this website.</li>
										<li>Task: This section contains the learner's task. The task is to learn about the healthcare degrees and certificates available through WCC. Then, for each pathway, the learner must determine whether it would be a good fit for them or not.</li>
										<li>Process: The learner is provided with the steps they must follow to complete the assignment. Learners will collect information about WCC's 15 healthcare pathways. They will document their data on a spreadsheet. After reviewing each pathway, they will record on the spreadsheet whether they would choose that pathway for themselves and explain their answer.</li>
										<li>Evaluation: A grading rubric is provided so that learners can evaluate their spreadsheets and be prepared to submit it to the instructor for grading. The instruction will use this same rubric to evaluate student submissions.</li>
										<li>Conclusion: The learner is reminded that there are a lot of potential career options available that they might not know about yet. The learner is encouraged to continue the search for a career that will suit them.</li>
									</ul>
