							<h1>Lesson Plan</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img class="path" src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Purpose</h2>
							<p>
								Most students are familiar with the idea of being a nurse or a doctor when they grow up. 
								They are less familiar with the numerous other career options that exist in healthcare. 
								Our local community college offers 15 affordable healthcare certificates and degrees. 
								This educational material and lesson plan was designed to encourage students to explore their options.
							</p>
							<h2>Rationale</h2>
							<p>
								There are many job opportunities for those interested in working in healthcare. 
								Students may become interested in those jobs once they learn what they are, 
								their expected salaries, and how much additional schooling they require.
							</p>
							<h2>Learner Description</h2>
							<p>This educational material and lesson plan was designed for 8th grade students in the Career Investigations course at Grayson County Career and Technical Education Center.</p>
							<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
							<p>This lesson requires that students be familiar with web browsers and navigating on the internet. 
								In order to organize their information using the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FIoR967tm4RHvXIlvA2mVJx7-lYuiaEV3VgiiCnmVm4/edit?usp=sharing">provided spreadsheet</a>, then students will require 
								familiarity with Google Sheets or another similar spreadsheet programs.
							</p>
							<h2>Instructional Objectives</h2>
							<p>The learner will compare and contrast 15 healthcare career pathways. Using this information, the learner will decide which pathway is best for themselves.</p>
							<p>For each career path, the learner will:
								<ul>
									<li>Write down job descriptions for the 15 career pathways available at Wytheville Community College (WCC). 
										If adequate descriptions are not available on the WCC websites, students will use Google to discover answers.
									</li>
									<li>Rate, on a scale of one through five, how interesting a career pathway is to them</li>
									<li>Identify whether WCC offers a degree or certificate for each pathway</li>
									<li>Identify the length of time needed to complete the coursework for each career path at WCC</li>
									<li>Identify the median salary in our area</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<h2>Standards Addressed</h2>
							<p>This lesson satisfies course competencies for 
								<a target="_blank" href="http://cteresource.org/curriculum/career-connections/Career%20Investigations%209070-9069-9068.pdf">9068/9069/9070 Career Investigations</a>.

							<h2>Lesson Format</h2>
							<p>
								This lesson follows the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.webquest.org/">WebQuest Model</a>, which was developed by Bernie Dodge and Tom March. 
							</p>
								It contains the following sections for learners:

Introduction: This section provides an overview to help learners to become familiar with the topic.
Task: The task to be completed is described in this section. Learners will develop a policy brief outlining blogger rights and liabilities. This document will be prepared in a world processor. The final version should be high quality and suitable for informational use in a school or workplace.
Process: The list of steps to follow are provided. Learners will synthesize information found in a series of articles and videos. A discussion forum will be used to talk about the problems, issues, and consequences of blogging discovered in the articles and videos. The discussion is held online for one week. After the discussion week learners will work individually to write a policy brief that is suitable for their own school or workplace.
Evaluation: A rubric is provided to allow learners to self-score their projects. This same rubric will be used by the instructor to assign a grade for work completed in this WebQuest.
Conclusion: This section is used to prompt the learner to think about what they have learned during this WebQuest. What are the implications for the future?
							</p>
							<h2>Assessment</h2>
							<p>
								Students will complete a spreadsheet that contains information about the healthcare degrees and certificates 
								offered at WCC. Students will use the information they gather to decide which of the pathways they would choose for themselves. 
								Their spreadsheet will be assessed with the <a href="rubric.html">Grading Rubric</a>.
