            <p>Please hunt for the answers on this page: <a href="https://plagiarism.org/blog/2017/11/16/what-does-confidence-have-to-do-with-plagiarism" target="_blank">What Does Confidence Have to do with Plagiarism?</a></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Please list four reasons why students plagiarize.</li>
                <p>One reason why students plagiarize is that some students do not feel like using their energy to do the work. 
                    Other students may not understand when to cite their sources or how. 
                    A third reason is that some students procrastinate or otherwise mismanage their time. 
                    Finally, some students plagiarize because they do not believe they have what it takes 
                    to write an answer that will earn them the grade they want. 
                </p>
                <li>How can you increase your confidence and skill as a writer?</li>   
                <p>The way to increase your confidence and skill as a writer is to practice writing and getting 
                    feedback on your writing.
                </p>
                <li>What negative effects does plagiarism have on your confidence and your education?</li>     
                <p>When you plagiarize, you deny yourself the chance to practice writing and receive feedback on your writing.
                    Without the opportunity to improve you writing skills, your confidence in your writing will likely decrease. This is a 
                    disservice to you and your education.

            <h3>Hunt #4 - Preventing Plagiarism</h3>
            <p>Please hunt for the answers on this page: <a href="https://www.plagiarism.org/article/preventing-plagiarism-when-writing" target="_blank">Preventing Plagiarism when Writing
            </a></p>
            <ol>
                <li>If you are not sure as to whether an idea came from your or from another source, provide a citation. This includes 
                    any sources of inspiration or concepts that were critical to developing your ideas. 
                    Providing citations will strengthen your work in several ways. Please list at least two ways.
                </li>
                <p>Providing citations shows your reader that you are building upon the ideas of others. 
                    Citations also strengthen and validate your own original ideas. 
                    Finally, citations make it clear to your reader which ideas are uniquely yours, for which you deserve personal credit for.
                </p>
                <li>True or False: If you are paraphrasing someone's work, you must change both the words and the sentence structure.</li>  
                <p>True, if you are paraphrasing someone's work, you must change both the words and the sentence structure</p> 
                <li>If you have successfully changed both the wording and the sentence structure, do you still need to cite your source?</li>  
                <p>Yes, even if you have successfully changed both the wording and the sentence structure, you must still cite your source.</p>
