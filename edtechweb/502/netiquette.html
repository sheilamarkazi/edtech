            <h2>Using the Machinery</h2>
            <p>You must first be trained by your instructor prior to using any machine. Speficially, this includes the laser cutter, CNC mill, 3D printer, and vinyl cutter. Training includes both how to use ay relevant design software, as well as operating the machinery.
                You may create your designs at any computing station. When it is time to use the machine, you must notify your instructor. Your instructor is responsible for providing
                the appropriate supervision and will provide any assistance you require while using the machinery.
