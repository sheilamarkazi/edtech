            <p>The goal of web accessibility is to promote equal access to a website's information.</p>
            <p>Web accessibility is the pracice of minimizing barriers so that individuals with disabilities can interact with 
                a web page. Disabilities can be permanent, temporary, or <a href="https://userway.org/blog/how-situational-disabilities-impact-us-all" target="_blank">depend on the situation</a>. Have you ever been in a loud 
                classroom where you cannot hear the video in your assignment? That is an example of a situational disability. 
                Video captioning can help you in this situationn.</p>
            <p>Web accessibility practices can be used to address many needs such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Visual impairments</li>
                <li>Hearing impairments</li>
                <li>Limited mobility</li>
                <li>Learning diffiulties, such as dyslexia and <a href="https://www.readandspell.com/us/dyscalculia-in-adults" target="_blank">dyscalculia</a></li>
                <li>And much <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/abilities-barriers/" target="_blank">more</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="tools">Tools for Understanding</h2>
            <p>What is it like to interact with a website when you have a disability? It can be challenging to put ourselves 
                in another person's shoes. Abilities have a huge range, as each person is unique. 
                Here are just a few examples of how web information might be. 
                experienced by different people with different abilities.
            </p>
            <h3>Cochlear Implant</h3>
            <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/otolaryngology/specialty_areas/cochlear-implant-center/calculator.html" target="_blank"><img src="../images/cochlear.png" class="pic" alt="Profile view of woman with a medical technician placing the external components of a cochlear implant over her ear."></a>
            <p>Cochlear implants are devices that assist individuals with hearing loss. 
                Cochlear implants help people hear. However, they have a unique sound quality. 
                <a href="https://ais.southampton.ac.uk/cochlear-implant/cochlear-implant-sound-like/?_cyrenauthtype_=cookie" target="_blank">Listen to what cochlear implants sound like.</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Color Blindness</h3>
            <p>Some people see color differently from most people. This can make it challenging to view information
                on a website. For example, some people see green and red as very similar colors. 
                <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/designing-for-colorblind-improves-design/" target="_blank">
                    Look at examples of how color blindness can affect visual perception.</a>
                <p>Imagine a website displaying green text on a red background. Some people would find that very hard to read!</p>
            <h3>Learn More</h3>
                To gain more insight about different user experiences, 
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/#onlinestudent" target="_blank">read stories about 
                user scenarios.</a>
